Hey folks, DO you use mac ?? Yeah ? Great !!! 
Lets make it more beautiful 

1. Get rid-off boring terminal and lets go for iTerm
=============
Download the iTerm terminal from

2. To install applications from command line you will need a brew package manager available for mac os x.
=============
steps to install home-brew
 - Open your iTerm (````command+space```` then type iterm )
 - Type this command on iTerm window 
 - ```` ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ````
 - There you go !!!
 -  Now you can install any app from command line e.g ````brew cask install google-chrome ````

3. Lets make your Iterm more beautiful
=============
Lets use a zsh configurations to make iterm cool.
steps to install oh-my-zsh
- Open your iTerm.
- Type the following command on iTerm window.
- ```` sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)" ````
-  Congo !! now yor are zsh user.

4. Lets customise your zsh profile
=============
- Now type the following command
- ```` vi ~/.zshrc ````   
- You will see zsh configuration file in your vim
- At the top of the file you can see ```` ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell" ````
- 'robbyrussell' is a deault theme and you can change the theme as you wish.
-  e.g keeping it as ```` 'ZSH_THEME=random' ```` will generate a new random theme each time you open up your iTerm.
-  Type the command ````source ~/.zshrc ````( basically this command loads your all zsh profile enviorment variables and   settings)

5. Some more terminal(iTerm) shortcuts:
=============
- Typing the ````command+D```` will split yout terminal into the 2 vertical sections. This helps you when you want more than one sessions for working.
- Typing ```` command+shift+D```` will split the window horizontally.
- You can also set the aliases for your frequently used command by typing the command ```` alias new_name='command_name ```` - e.g ````alias ex = 'exit'```` and now again load your settings by typing the command ````source ~/.zshrc ````
- From next time onwards whenever you wish to exit from iterm, you can simply type 'ex'

6. Fun part ;)
=============
- Try command ````say "hello" ```` (Your mac will speak out whatever you have specified :D)
- Lets put this in your zshrc file and load zshrc file and Let mac welcomes you whenever you start your laptop or terminal
